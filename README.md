This project was done to fully understand the C++ classes, virtual methods and inheritance work.
To be able to convert the C++ classes into C you should be able to understand the whole process of 
struct generation, vtable creation and inheritance technique.
The program has few restrictions : everything should be written with space(sorry for that).
But the idea in educational. In the files I pushed, there is a Cplusplus.txt, it's an example of the code you write,
and C.txt , the resukt you get from the C++ code. If you just copy and paaste BOTH files in your editor and g++ it 
you'll get the same result. And that was the goal of this project. If you have any quesions, just contact me.
